# dock-spacer
This is a wrapper for the defaults command
`defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'` and others.
Those commands will add a new spacer (and more, read the source for more info) to the OS X dock.

Tested on Yosemite, should be working for all versions from 10.5 and newer.
