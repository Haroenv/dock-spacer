# dock-spacer
This is a wrapper for the defaults command
`defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'` and others.
Those commands will add a new spacer (and more, read the source for more info) to the OS X dock.

This is tested on Yosemite, should be working for all versions from 10.5 and newer.

# Installation

Clone this directory with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Haroenv/dock-spacer.git
```

Or download the zip, if you play that way.

Another option is to `curl` the script

```sh
curl -o dock-spacer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haroenv/dock-spacer/master/dock-spacer.sh
```

And then just run the script from the downloaded directory.
